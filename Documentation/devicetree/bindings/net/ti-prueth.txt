Texas Instruments PRUSS Ethernet MAC
====================================

Required properties:
- compatible       : Should be one of the following,
                        "ti,am3359-prueth" for AM335x SoCs
                        "ti,am4376-prueth" for AM437x SoCs
                        "ti,am57-prueth" for AM57xx SoCs
                        "ti,k2g-prueth" for 66AK2G SoCs

- prus             : list of pHandles to the PRU nodes
- firmware-name	   : list of strings containing firmware path.
- sram	           : pHandle to OCMC SRAM node
- interrupt-parent : pHandle to the PRUSS INTC node
- rx-queue-size    : Array of queue sizes in rx direction (Ingress)
                     Format /bits/ 16 <q1 q2 q3 q4>
                     Note that the queue size value (q1/q2/q3/q4)
                     has to be non-zero

    If no q size config exists for a particular port in
    dts, the following defaults for that port will
    be used.

    EMAC/HSR/PRP Defaults:
    host: rx-queue-size = /bits/ 16 <194 194 194 194>
    mii0: tx-queue-size = /bits/ 16 <97 97 97 97>
    mii1: tx-queue-size = /bits/ 16 <97 97 97 97>

Optional properties:
- interrupt-names  : If enabling packet priority based interrupts for HSR/PRP,
		     should be "rx_red_hp", "rx_red_lp".
- interrupts       : should contain an array of PRUSS system event
                     numbers.

Must contain children, one for each of the MAC ports.
Children must be named ethernet-mii0 and ethernet-mii1.
Either one or both children can be present. If only one
child is present driver operates in single EMAC mode.

For single mode operation with the 2nd PRU, you still need
to provide both PRUs and firmware-names but the firmware-name
for the first PRU can be NULL. See 2nd example.

Required properties for children:
- phy-handle       : See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- phy-mode         : See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- interrupt-names  : should be "rx", "tx", "emac_ptp_tx", and "hsrprp_ptp_tx".
                     emac_ptp_tx and hsrprp_ptp_tx are optional.
- interrupts       : should contain an array of PRUSS system event
                     numbers used as the interrupt sources for Rx
                     Tx and PTP Tx event packet timestamping respectively.
- tx-queue-size    : Array of queue sizes in tx direction (Egress)
                     Format /bits/ 16 <q1 q2 q3 q4>.
                     Note that the queue size value (q1/q2/q3/q4) has
                     to be non-zero.

NOTE: When changing queue sizes, make sure that the sum of all queue
sizes across ingress or host (defined by rx-queue-size or default values
in the driver) and egress or mii0/1 ports (defined by port specific
tx-queue-size or default values in the driver) must be less than or
equal to 1552.

Optional properties for children:
- local-mac-address	: mac address for the port.

Example (am572x-idk board, dual-emac):
======================================
	pruss2_eth {
		compatible = "ti,am57-prueth";
		prus = <&pru2_0>, <&pru2_1>;
		firmware-name = "ti-pruss/am57xx-pru0-prueth-fw.elf",
				"ti-pruss/am57xx-pru1-prueth-fw.elf";
		sram = <&ocmcram1>;
		interrupt-parent = <&pruss2_intc>;

		pruss2_emac0: ethernet-mii0 {
			phy-handle = <&pruss2_eth0_phy>;
			phy-mode = "mii";
			interrupts = <20>, <22>, <23>, <26>;
			interrupt-names = "rx", "tx", "hsrprp_ptp_tx",
					  "emac_ptp_tx";
			/* Filled in by bootloader */
			local-mac-address = [00 00 00 00 00 00];
		};

		pruss2_emac1: ethernet-mii1 {
			phy-handle = <&pruss2_eth1_phy>;
			phy-mode = "mii";
			interrupts = <21>, <23>, <24>, <27>;
			interrupt-names = "rx", "tx", "hsrprp_ptp_tx",
					  "emac_ptp_tx";
			/* Filled in by bootloader */
			local-mac-address = [00 00 00 00 00 00];
		};
	};

Example (am572x-idk board, single-emac):
=======================================
	pruss2_eth {
		compatible = "ti,am57-prueth";
		prus = <&pru2_0>, <&pru2_1>;
		firmware-name = "",
				"ti-pruss/am57xx-pru1-prueth-fw.elf";
		sram = <&ocmcram1>;
		interrupt-parent = <&pruss2_intc>;

		pruss2_emac1: ethernet-mii1 {
			phy-handle = <&pruss2_eth1_phy>;
			phy-mode = "mii";
			interrupts = <21>, <23>, <24>, <27>;
			interrupt-names = "rx", "tx", "hsrprp_ptp_tx",
					  "emac_ptp_tx";
			/* Filled in by bootloader */
			local-mac-address = [00 00 00 00 00 00];
